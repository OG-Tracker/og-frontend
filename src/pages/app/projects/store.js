        summary: "The purpose of this proposal is to secure funding for a social experiment designed to test the efficiency of the candle auction format used in Polkadot's parachain slot allocation. While auctions are a proven mechanism for efficient resource allocation, the candle auction format, originating from the 16th century, is less understood and lacks comprehensive academic evaluation. This experiment will simulate Polkadot's parachain auction scenario, analyzing its performance against alternative auction closing rules such as hard-close and activity rule formats. The experiment will involve 180 participants from the University of Heidelberg, focusing on efficiency and revenue outcomes.",

        summary: "The purpose of this proposal is to request a technical rollback for the Bitgreen parachain following a runtime upgrade issue. The Bitgreen parachain was upgraded from a shell runtime to a full runtime at block 191202. Although the upgrade was initially successful and the chain continued producing blocks, the new runtime introduced a pallet (pallet-parachain-staking) that was not initialized with any values. As a result, the session pallet was set with an empty validator set, disrupting the chain’s normal operation. The proposal seeks to resolve this by resetting the parachain.",

Kampela is designed as a hardware alternative to the Parity Signer, featuring a compact, card-like form factor with an e-paper display and unidirectional NFC for secure data transmission. This device prioritizes security, housing a cryptographic chip that stores private keys and handles all signing operations, while maintaining a simplified user interface for single-seed operation.",

With the full activation of pallet-bags-list in runtime 9170, the need for a strict cap on nomination intentions has decreased. The proposal suggests increasing the maximum number of nomination intentions to 50,000, allowing a broader range of participants. Additionally, it recommends lowering the minimum stake required to submit a nomination intention to 10 DOT. These changes aim to make nomination participation more accessible while maintaining a controlled upper limit as a precautionary measure.",

        summary: "The purpose of this proposal is to establish an Anti-Scam Bounty aimed at combating scams within the Polkadot ecosystem through a coordinated community effort. The initiative expands on the ongoing anti-scam efforts targeting fraudulent websites and introduces a broader approach addressing various scam tactics. It involves multiple tasks such as detecting and taking down scam sites, developing educational materials, creating automated tools for scam prevention, and collaborating with antivirus services and exchanges. The initiative seeks to integrate on-chain processes, enhance community-driven responses, and extend protections across the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.",

Although the upgrade was successful, Statemint collators could not produce blocks due to a key type mismatch. Aura uses sr25519 keys for block signing, but the keys in the genesis chain specification were mistakenly generated using ed25519. This proposal introduces a temporary runtime fix to enable ed25519 in Aura for Statemint, allowing validators on the Relay Chain to validate collator signatures. Once block production resumes, a subsequent runtime upgrade will revert Aura back to sr25519 keys.",

Currently, the maximum nominator count has reached its limit of 22,500, preventing new nominators from joining. To address this, the proposal suggests increasing the minimum nominator bond from 40 DOTs to 80 DOTs, allowing nominators with higher backing stake to participate and encouraging less staked nominators to be chilled. Additionally, a new chill-threshold parameter of 90% is introduced to ensure that permissionless chilling can only be triggered when the maximum nominator count is nearly full.",

With the upcoming 9080 runtime upgrade enabling signed submissions, this motion ensures all staking solutions (from offchain workers or signed miners) meet at least 50% of the average election scores from the past 50 eras.",

Building on the SubstraTEE framework, the proposed architecture allows direct invocation of confidential transactions, bypassing the need for intermediary processing on layer one, thereby significantly boosting transaction throughput and reducing latency. The new model introduces sidechains for sharded confidential state with sub-second block times, using TEEs for block validation without requiring Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus. This approach directly benefits existing projects like Encointer and supports a broader range of substrate-based chains by providing a scalable, secure second-layer solution that integrates seamlessly with layer one governance and finality.",

Building on the SubstraTEE framework, the proposed architecture allows direct invocation of confidential transactions, bypassing the need for intermediary processing on layer one, thereby significantly boosting transaction throughput and reducing latency. The new model introduces sidechains for sharded confidential state with sub-second block times, using TEEs for block validation without requiring Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus. This approach directly benefits existing projects like Encointer and supports a broader range of substrate-based chains by providing a scalable, secure second-layer solution that integrates seamlessly with layer one governance and finality.",
